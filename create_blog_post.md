# Create a Blog Post

##### About this document

Anyone is welcome to create and host a blog entry here.  You may get paid, per this [proposal](https://dashcommunity.github.io/proposal-dash-community/).  Follow the steps below to create and post your entry. 

### Join Dash Community
1. If you haven't already, [join Dash Community](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/join_dash_community.md)

### Create Your Entry
Since you are likely not a `dashcommunity/blog` *owner* after step 2 below you will see a message stating:

> You're creating a file in a project you don't have write accesss to.  We've created a fork of the project for you to commit your proposed changes to.  Submitting a change will create the file in a new branch in your fork, so you can send a pull request.

Until we work out a better solution (e.g. creating a blogging team, etc) this will be the default permission level, and the process will require the **Prepare a Pull Request** steps below. 

1. Navigate to the [articles directory of the blog repository](https://github.com/riongull/blog/tree/master/pages/articles)
2. Click **Create new file**
3. Name your file something
  * give it a `.md` file extension
  *  `.md` stands for `m`ark`d`own
4. Compose your entry using [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
5. Click **Propose new file**

### Prepare a Pull Request
After you've completed the **Create Your Entry** steps above, you are taken to the **Comparing changes** page.  This looks scary if you aren't familiar with git and GitHub, but basically what you did in the previous steps was you created a repository on your own account that was forked from the dashcommunity organization.  So far, your post is privately hosted on your own account, but you now are being asked if you'd like to request that your private post be merged (or pulled) into the `dashcommunity` repository.  In other words, you are going to **open a pull request**.  These steps are shown below.

1. Click **Create pull request**
2. Add a `description` and `comment` if you wish (optional)
3. Click **Create pull request** (again)

You're done.  Now you just wait for the request to be merged by an organization *owner*.  You may return to this page at any time and click **Close pull request**, which basically cancels/undoes the request.  You may also comment on this pull request by filling out the `Leave a comment` box, and clicking **Comment**. 

### Share Your Entry
After your entry has been merged in you can now share the link to your entry.

1. Navigate to the [blog repository](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog)
  * if you don't see your entry it hasn't been merged in yet, come back later
2. Click on your newly created file
3. Click **Copy path**
4. Share on in your favorite forums (e.g. Slack, Dash Forum, etc)
  *  the [blog landing page](https://dashcommunity.github.io/blog/) will be updated with your entry when a repository admin adds it (which is a manual process for now)
